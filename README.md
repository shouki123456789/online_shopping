AI to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.

## Overview:

The project aims to predict user purchasing intent on an online shopping website using machine learning techniques, specifically by building a nearest-neighbor classifier. The classifier analyzes various features extracted from user browsing sessions, such as the number of pages visited, session duration, bounce rates, exit rates, browser type, and operating system, to predict whether a user intends to make a purchase. The primary motivation behind this endeavor is to personalize the user experience by offering targeted promotions or discounts, thereby increasing the likelihood of completing a purchase. The dataset utilized for this project comprises approximately 12,000 user sessions from an online shopping website. Each session is characterized by a set of features and a binary label indicating whether the user made a purchase during the session.

## Objective:

The main objective is to train a nearest-neighbor classifier on the dataset to learn patterns associated with user purchasing behavior. The model's performance is evaluated using sensitivity and specificity metrics to measure its ability to correctly identify positive (purchase) and negative (no purchase) cases.
